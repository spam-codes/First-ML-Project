# First-ML-Project
Hey there,
This is my first beginner-level machine learning project completed by following Jason Brownlee's "Your First Machine Learning Project In Python Step-By-Step " tutorial. I followed all the steps mentioned in this tutorial. This project uses the "Iris Dataset" to train and compare multiple machine learning algorithms for flower classification.

Project Overview:
In this project, i :
• Installed all the necessary libraries/dependencies 
• Loaded the dataset
• Summarized and visualized the data set (Univariate plot and Multivariate plot)
• Used different machine learning algorithms 
• Reached the result

Libraries:
•Matplotlib
•Scipy
•numpy
•pandas
•sklearn
[ Used Jupyter Notebook as interactive environment ] 


DATASET :
The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flower with features like:

• Sepal-length
•Sepal-width
•Petal-length
•Petal-width
(All in cm)

ALGORITHMs Used:
•Logistic Regression (LR)
•Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
•K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
•Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
•Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
•Support Vector Machines (SVM)

RESULT:
Best Model :
Accuracy:
